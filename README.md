## Application Details:
Our app was a Mystery Number Challenge game created with React Native using the coding language of Typescript.  The game had to enable the user to enter a random number between 1 and 100. The user is expected to enter their guess.  After entering the guess the user should click the button in order to see if it displays the correct result.  

# Design Considerations 


# Feautures
With the following app, we used a for loop that ran through the app in order to check the user's guess comparing it with the secret guess number. 
The for loop also enabled the app to update the guess count and display the feedback. 
We also used the 'useState' to handle the secret number, user's guess, and the guess count.
